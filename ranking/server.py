It first classifies ADUs based on their polarity (supporting or opposing) and further organizes them by their frames (e.g., economic, environmental) to cater to diverse user perspectives. Lastly, it clusters ADUs by meaning to minimize redundancy, ensuring a diverse yet concise representation of arguments. The result is a structured JSON output that systematically presents clustered ADUs for enhanced navigability and comprehension.",
